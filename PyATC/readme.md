#PyATC

##What is this?
Howdy Hey! This is a project written in Python using the Kivy Library 

##What is it about?
PyATC is an air traffic control simulator whereby the user controls departing and arriving aircraft through the text input and sees the action take place real-time from the 2D airport view

##I mean, it sounds great, but the code is crap
I know, this game is meant to suck slowly less and less as time goes by (and I learn), so I guess you simply read this too early... See you in 12 years!

##What do I need to run it?
macOS, Windows, Linux or a toaster with a more or less up to date version of 
- Python and 
- the Kivy Library 

##Other
Special thanks to Harry Dalton, Mr M Skilton and Rachel Wong, for without them this would just be an idea
